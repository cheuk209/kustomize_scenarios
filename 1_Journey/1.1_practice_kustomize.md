the latest version of unit restriction manager has introduced a limit range patch in overlay/env that specifies a 3GB memory default on all containers, and now its 2 cronjobs aren't scheduling. i've raised this in the promotions chat. in the meantime the fix is 2 resource patches on the cronjobs, you can mirror PR's 1692 & 1693 in SIT-UAT which resolved this. these 2 patches are pending in CR train, ORT, pre prod & prod


Here is problem statement.

Unit restriction manager is a module we have deployed. 

A **LimitRange patch** in Kubernetes is a configuration that sets default resource limits (like CPU and memory) for containers in a namespace. It ensures that containers don’t use too many or too few resources, which helps maintain cluster stability.

In **Kustomize**, a LimitRange patch is often used in overlays to modify or enforce these defaults for specific environments (like dev, test, prod). For example, you might patch the LimitRange to set a default memory limit of 3GB for all containers in a namespace.

**Why is it important?**
- **Prevents resource overuse:** Stops containers from consuming excessive resources.
- **Ensures fair sharing:** Makes sure all workloads get a fair share of resources.
- **Avoids scheduling issues:** If defaults are too high, some workloads (like small cronjobs) may not schedule if they can’t get the required resources.

In your case, the patch set a 3GB memory default, which was too high for the cronjobs, causing them not to schedule. That’s why resource patches are needed to override the default for those jobs.
